# Setup
1. Create directory named "_evobackup_archives"  on your root webserver to hold modx .zip archives, and set read/write permissions to 777
2. Install EvoBackup with Package Manager or Extras module
3. Run EvoBackup module
4. Select additional folders and files to include in the archive
5. Click Backup, if it works there should be a .zip link containing your modx site.

## Change Backup directory (not required)
1. Edit /assets/modules/evobackup/settings.php, and set $modx_backup_dir to backup dir in new directory
2. Set Module configuration > **Backup Directory** to your new backup dir

# troubleshooting
#### 1) module does not complete backup, stops with a temp file

**Solution**
Remove some folders from backup or increase "ZIP memory limit" value in module configuration page

# to do

* **change backup folder path**: avoid edit hardcoded path in settings.php
